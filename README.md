# UbuntuResourceUsage

## Final Project of my Research Methodology Class

During my class of Research Project my final research was about the performance of the browsers Google Chrome and Firefox running on Ubuntu in the computers of my classmates. The main purpose of this project was to get the next 6 plots whose show the peformance of each browser through 11 tests and using 6 different metrics. Consult the `FinalProjectReport.pdf` file to get more information about the project.

The data of each sample is inside of a directory inside the `data/` directory. The commands used are inside the `command` file. The next plots were obtained thanks to the python code inside the `main.py` file.
